/*You are given a special linked list with N nodes where each node has a next pointer pointing to its next node. You are also 
given M random pointers, where you will be given M number of pairs denoting two nodes a and b. Random Pointers pointing any random nodes.
Construct a copy of the given list. The copy should consist of exactly N new nodes, where each new nodes has its value set to 
the value of its corresponding original node. Both the next and random pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in 
the copy list represent the same list state. None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list.
